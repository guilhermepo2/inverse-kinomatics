# Inverse Kinomatics

A Simple Game I've developed for the Computer Graphics Essay, I had to do something in Unity and using 3D. I also wanted to mess with shaders and Inverse Kinematics, so I came up with this. You can read more about it and see a video [here](http://gueepo.me/assets/games/kinomatics.html).


This is by no means a finished project.

This is by no means a polished project.

This is by no means even a good game programming example.


If you somehow are here and have some interest in it, be careful on what you take from it.
